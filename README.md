**Exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP) with FastText**
**Overview**
Welcome to the repository dedicated to exploring the fascinating world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using FastText! In this repository, we delve into the principles, applications, and significance of NLP, with a special focus on leveraging the FastText library.

**About NLP**
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and contextually appropriate. It encompasses a wide range of tasks, including text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, named entity recognition, and more.

**About FastText**
FastText is a library for efficient learning of word representations and sentence classifications. Developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR), FastText provides tools for generating word embeddings, which represent words as dense vectors in a high-dimensional space. These embeddings capture semantic relationships between words and enable powerful NLP applications.
